# Colors

Colors in CSS can be described in three different ways:
1. **Named colors** — English words that describe colors, also called keyword colors
2. **RGB** — numeric values that describe a mix of red, green, and blue
3. **HSL** — numeric values that describe a mix of hue, saturation, and lightness
